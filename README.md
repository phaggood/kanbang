kanbANG!

Kanban on Angular and NodeJS

To run, install NodeJS from here: http://nodejs.org

Check out this repo into a directory.  CD to that directory.

run 'npm install'.  Wait for dependencies to finish.

type 'node web-server.js' to start the server; takes a couple of seconds

Open browser to localhost:9090 to view the Kanban.

Notes:

Only ITS jiras are loaded, I have yet to add Sakai to the api
I also have not added the extra search filters; these too will be added soon.

To run the unit tests, open 'SpecRunner.html' in your browser; tests run automatically

E2E and loadtests are not yet included.
